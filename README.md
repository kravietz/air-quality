# Air quality monitoring with Arduino

These are Arduino prototypes for monitoring air quality (mostly particulates) with various sensors available on the market. Main motivation
is to monitor air quality in Krakow, my home town in Poland, which is long known for notorious exceeding of air quality limits due to large
usage of coal and rubbish for heating by the local population ([Krakow combats smog menace](http://www.thenews.pl/1/6/Artykul/152431,Krakow-combats-smog-menace)).

The town is monitoring pollution levels but the monitoring stations are few and not really located in the worst areas. This effort is
an attempt to build a cheap pollution monitor that could be deployed by volunteers in a wide range of locations across the city. Even if
the data provided is not really scientific or industrial quality, it can be still very useful to see that, for example, *"today it's 10x more
pollution than yesterday"*.
